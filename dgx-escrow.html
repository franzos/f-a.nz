<p>Here's how it works:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Signal your intention to buy / sell DGX</li>
  <li>Once a matching buyer / seller has been found, both parties will be notified</li>
  <li>Both parties post their ETH address, and I publizise the escrow account address</li>
  <li>The seller sends the agreed amount of DGX to the escrow account</li>
  <li>The buyer sends the required amount of ETH, to cover the purchase of the DGX</li>
  <li>The agent (myself) verifies and approves the transaction</li>
  <li>The balance is released to both seller and buyer</li>
</ol>

<p class="light"><em><b>(1)</b> Once both parties have been notified, and 24 hours pass without the successful completion of the transaction, the balance will be refunded. <b>(2)</b> The maximum amount per transaction for unknown parties is $500 USD. <b>(3)</b> For repeat-transactions, that means, the same two parties or ETH accounts, the maximum amount per transaction is capped at $2500 USD. <b>(4)</b> I retain a 2% transaction fee, or minimum $5 USD in order to cover my time and ETH network fees. <b>(5)</b> In order to push for transparency, I prefer to keep all transactions public. If you do not want to publish your main ETH account address here, you may create a new, temporary one on <a href="https://www.myetherwallet.com/">MEW</a>.</em></p>

<div class="inline-section">
  <h2 class="block">Post your buy / sell request</h2>

    <p class="light">To initiate a new request, state the amount you're looking to buy or sell. Example:
      <br><em>Selling 50 DGX at market rate</em>
      <br><em>Selling 100 DGX at 0.12 ETH / DGX</em>
      <br><em>Selling #T0411-01, 5 DGX</em>
      <br><em>Buying 1000 DGX at 0.115 ETH / DGX, private</em>
      <br>
      <br>If you prefer to keep your ETH address private, please mention it in the comment. Private transactions are handled via email, or chat. The transaction fee is 5%.
