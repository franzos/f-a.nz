<u>My Name is Franz Geffke</u> - I was born and raised in East Germany but today my home is anywhere between Europe, the Middle-East and Southeast-Asia. New experiences and culture draw me to travel to, and live in different countries all around the world - With stronger foreign ties come a different, new perspective on all aspects of life and business which I continue to embrace.

Apart from my travels, I'm a privacy advocate and supporter of technologies and ideas that help promote personal freedom, decentralize certain aspects of power, and are easily accessible to everyone - now or in the near future.

Whenever I'm not working, I like to disconnect and return a different era - with crackling vinyls and glowing amplifiers.

Here's what I'm reading: [Bookshelf](/bookshelf/)

## Work

I'm a full-stack engineer with over 12 years of experience building secure, scalable systems across multiple industries. Having lived and worked across Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, I bring a unique perspective to technical challenges and understand diverse market needs.

My expertise spans:

- **Blockchain Applications**: Developing crypto exchanges, NFT marketplaces, and smart contract implementations
- **IoT Solutions**: Creating remote health monitoring systems and IoT gateways with real-time data processing
- **Full-Stack Development**: Crafting responsive web applications and mobile apps with modern frameworks

What sets me apart is my ability to bridge technical expertise with real-world business requirements. I don't just build technologyâ€”I deliver solutions that solve specific problems and create measurable value for organizations of all sizes.
