<u>My Name is Franz Geffke</u> - I was born and raised in East Germany but today my home is anywhere between Europe, the Middle-East and Southeast-Asia. New experiences and culture draw me to travel to, and live in different countries all around the world - With stronger foreign ties come a different, new perspective on all aspects of life and business which I continue to embrace.

Apart from my travels, I'm a privacy advocate and supporter of technologies and ideas that help promote personal freedom, decentralize certain aspects of power, and are easily accessible to everyone - now or in the near future.

Whenever I'm not working, I like to disconnect and return a different era - with crackling vinyls, glowing amplifiers and a glass of scotch - no ice.

Here's what I'm reading: [Bookshelf](/bookshelf/)

Franz was great to work with, keen to test new ideas and push the work into new and exciting areas. The content he produced was central to a social campaign that was really innovative and effective in generating engagement from diverse audiences across multiple platforms. - Ewan Gaffney, GEW UK
