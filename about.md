My Name is Franz Geffke - I was born and raised in Germany but today my home is anywhere between Europe, the Middle-East and Southeast-Asia. New experiences and culture draw me to travel to, and to live in different countries all around the world - With stronger foreign ties come a different, new perspective on all aspects of life and business which I continue to embrace.

Aside from my travels, I'm a big privacy advocate and strong supporter of technologies and ideas that help promote personal freedom, decentralize certain aspects of power, and are easily accessible to everyone - now or in the near future.

Whenever I'm not working, I like to disconnect and return to the lifestyle of a different era - with crackling vinyls, glowing amplifiers and a glass of scotch - no ice.

## Work

My work covers a variety of aspects but to summarize, __I help organizations increase their reach and revenue by optimizing their product, online presence and backend-end processes__. I have clients ranging from startup and small business to international powerhouses and charities.
