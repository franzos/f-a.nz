Hi there!

It looks like you're in need of a developer, 
<br/>or someone to plan, hire for, and execute your project.

- I'm a developer with over half a life-time experience
- I've planned, hired for, and implemented large scale projects
- I work with a lot of clients 1:1; I'm good at translating ideas to spec

These days I work mostly with Typescript, Go and Python.
Other languages I play with, include Scheme, C/C++ and Rust.

Some of my recent projects include:

- [Nostr Social Media Client in React](https://f-a.nz/work/nostrop/)
- [OpenID Connect Mobile Authenticator in React Native](https://f-a.nz/work/mobile-authenticator/)
- [Ethereum NFT Marketplace, Vue.js front, Nest.js back](https://f-a.nz/work/onesnow-nft-marketplace/)

I push to GitHub occasionally: [github.com/franzos](https://github.com/franzos).
<br/>And here's my [resume](https://f-a.nz/resume/).

Drop me a mail at, [hire@f-a.nz](mailto:hire@f-a.nz) to get started.

PS: If you're in Portugal, let's meet.
