Just ``curl https://keybase.io/franzs/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import``, ``keybase pgp pull franzs`` if you're a Keybase user or simply copy-paste from [keybase.io/franzs/pgp_keys.asc](https://keybase.io/franzs/pgp_keys.asc).

If you're not familiar with GPG, you may still send me an encrypted message. Simply visit [keybase.io/encrypt](https://keybase.io/encrypt) and enter 'franzs' as the recipient. Once you're done, confirm with 'Encrypt' and copy-paste all of the resulting code into an Email. Only I will be able to decrypt and read your message.
