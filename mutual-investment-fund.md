<u>The G&P Mutual Investment Fund</u> is crypto-first, set-up primarily to counter crypto market volatility and inflation, to ensure steady value and optional growth.

## Assets

Crypto currencies and assets are chosen based on their track record (stability) and roadmap (growth). All assets are weighted, and re-allocated by hand, should one exceed a 30% share over 7 days.

- <b>LTC</b> Litecoin
- <b>ETC</b> Ethereum Classic
- <b>BTC</b> Bitcoin
- <b>XRP</b> Ripple
- <b>REP</b> Augur
- <b>ETH</b> Ethereum
- <b>ICN</b> Iconomi
- <b>DGD</b> DigixDAO

## Net asset value

The fund was initially conceived in February 2017. After a lot of research and testing, I've decided to start publishing performance data, in preparation for a future DAA (digital asset array) incorporation on either Iconomi or Melonport.

In the meantime, only a selected few are allowed to participate.
