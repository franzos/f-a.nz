Franz helped Youth Business International shape messaging and design engaging visual content for Global Entrepreneurship Week in the UK, a campaign that includes more than 3,000 events and 300,000 participants. Franz was great to work with, keen to test new ideas and push the work into new and exciting areas. The content he produced was central to a social campaign that was really innovative and effective in generating engagement from diverse audiences across multiple platforms. Looking forward to working with Franz on future campaigns.
