## The challenge

Learning Vue.js by writing my first application based on the JS framework.

[Preview on Heroku](https://ethereum-address-inspector.herokuapp.com/) / [Source code on Github](https://github.com/franzos/ethereum-address-inspector)

{% include project-image.html image="ethereum-address-inspector-01.jpg" %}

## What I did

- Implemented etherscan.io API for wallet transaction history
- Implemented coinmarketcap.com API for exchange rates (EURO/USD/ETH)
- Used Burma framework for layout and styling
- Hosted on Heroku
