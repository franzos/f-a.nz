## The challenge

Google Adwords has allowed Q-Windows Malaysia to actively pursue new clients and drive more traffic to their new, mobile-ready website but only few visitors got in touch and ad expenses kept rising.

## What I did

{% include project-image.html image="q-windows-06.jpg" %}

In an effort to capture leads from Google Adwords and Facebook ads, I have come up with a custom landing page. To maximize efficiency, we're A/B testing the landing page to maximize conversion rate and thus maximize our ROI on ads.

## The effects

We've seen improvements across the board:
- Ad expenditure is down by 60% without impact on number of enquiries
- Exit rate is down 21% (89% to 68%)
- Average visit duration is up by 1.47 minutes
- Conversion rate is at 7.2% for new visitors
