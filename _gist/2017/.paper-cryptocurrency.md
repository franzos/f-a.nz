We're all aware of the fact that cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, Litecoin or Ethereum only carry value, if there's a demand for it. Much like a $100 USD bill buys you $100 USD worth of stuff, so does ,068119891 Bitcoin (1 BTC = $1468 USD). The huge difference between what we call fiat money (USD, EUR, JPY) and cryptocurrency (BTC, LTC, ETH), is that unlike the cryptocurrency, it's easy to spend that $100 USD bill.

For now, the biggest challenge that remains is to get cryptocurrency in the hands of ordinary people, in a format that they can work with. Anybody who ever moved to a different country, understands what it means to adapt to a new currency. Lucky you, if the rate is something easy to break down - like 1:10. A bread that may cost $3 USD at home, is suddenly 3,600 FC (foreign currency), and the cab ride around town doesn't cost $18 USD but 21,000 FC. Imagine what will happen, if your bakery starts charging for the bread in Bitcoin: Due to volatile markets, today it may cost ,002043597 BTC and tomorrow ,002443597 BTC - that's not something the average person could break down, in order to determine potential price changes, or even to compare different products.
