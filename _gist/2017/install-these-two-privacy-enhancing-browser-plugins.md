There are two browser plugins which I consider must-have's. Not only do they eliminate advertising and cut down on unnecessary tracking, they also help reduce the website's size and speed-up your internet connection AND make your browser more responsive.

**How do they speed up my browsing experience?**

Easy: Most websites come with a lot of tracking software that monitor your browsing behavior, what you look at, click - where you came from. All these add to these size of the webpage you're looking at.

## Plugins

These plugins work on Chrome, Firefox and Safari (don't use Safari!)

### 1. uBlock
[www.ublock.org](https://www.ublock.org/): A fast, lightweight, and lean blocker.
