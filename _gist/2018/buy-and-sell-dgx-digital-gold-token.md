## What is DGX?

DGX is an Ethereum based cryptocurrency backed by physical gold stored in Singapore. That means, 1 DGX = 1g (99.99 LBMA) gold which, at the time of writing, is valued at $43.24 USD or 0.1157 ETH.

The advantages are huge:
- Unlike other cryptocurrencies DGX is backed by a physical assets
- Unlike USDT (backed by USD), DGX has no fractional reserves
- DGX can be stored on virtually any Ethereum compatible wallet
- Unlike gold, it's very easy, fast and cheap to transfer DGX

The only exchange that supports DGX as DGX/ETH trading pair is [EtherDelta](https://etherdelta.com/#0x4f3afec4e5a3f2a6a1a411def7d7dfe50ee057bf-ETH), a decentralized Ethereum & Ethereum token exchange. Unfortunately there's virtually no liquidity.

## How do I sell DGX?

There are essentially 3 options to sell your DGX:

- If you want to exchange 100 DGX, you can have the piece of gold shipped to you
- You can place a sell-order on [EtherDelta](https://etherdelta.com/#0x4f3afec4e5a3f2a6a1a411def7d7dfe50ee057bf-ETH), but I doubt you'll get a good deal
- You can use a escrow service

## DGX Escrow

Using an escrow service, you can exchange your DGX with virtually anybody, without having to trust them.
