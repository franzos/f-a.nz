~~Bitcoin are arguably the best way to send and receive money from around the world. While there are certainly strong arguments for _and_ against Bitcoin, I continue to wholeheartedly support this cryptocurrency.~~

**Update: 2018-01-20**

I've decided to stop accepting Bitcoin payments due to high fees and long confirmation times. Instead, I prefer payments in XRP, ETH, or DGX. To request a one-time wallet address, please send me an <a href="mailto:m@f-a.nz?subject=Wallet%20Address%20Request">email</a>.

## Where to buy Bitcoin?

There are hundreds of options but these are the ones I recommend:

- [bitcoin.de](https://www.bitcoin.de/en?cr=1) - very easy, for Europeans
- [kraken.com](https://www.kraken.com/) - crypto Exchange

Once you've obtained a Bitcoin, you can trade it on Kraken or exchange it for other cryptos such as Litecoin, Ripple or Monero on [Shapeshift](https://shapeshift.io/).

## Where to keep Bitcoin?

If you're storing a lot of value, it's best to invest in a hardware wallet such as the [Ledger Nano S](/gist/a-quick-look-ledger-nano-s-crypto-hardware-wallet/). The easiest option would probably be [Jaxx](https://jaxx.io/) with apps for iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, the ability to store different cryptocurrencies and built-in Shapeshift exchange.
